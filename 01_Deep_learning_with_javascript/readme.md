# Deep Learning with Javascript

Introductory chapter. A good one to go through if you have no idea about the machine learning jargons and concepts.

## Why ML to Javascript ?

"""
First, once a machine-learning model is trained, it must be deployed somewhere in
order to make predictions on real data (such as classifying images and text, detecting
events in audio or video streams, and so on). Without deployment, training a model is
just a waste of compute power. It is often desirable or imperative that the “somewhere”
is a web frontend. Readers of this book are likely to appreciate the overall importance
of the web browser.

## Use of Representation:

1. Representation can be used to ensure that the coordinates areappropriately mapped onto the graph

for example using polar coordinates instead of cartesian coordinates

## Algorithmic advances

1. better activation function
2. better weight initialization schemes
better optimization schemes

### Combining javascript and machine Learning

Just makes sense.

1. Computation on client side using pretrained models
2. Take my money.
